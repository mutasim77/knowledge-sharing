## Introduction to Neuromorphic Computing 🧠
### What is Neuromorphic Computing? 🤔
Neuromorphic computing is an advanced field of technology that mimics the way the human brain works. Unlike traditional computers that process information in a linear and structured way, neuromorphic systems try to replicate the brain's natural ability to handle information in a highly efficient and parallel manner. In simple terms, it's like trying to make a computer that "thinks" more like a brain rather than just following rigid instructions.
