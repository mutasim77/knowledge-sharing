# Research Tools & Methods ðŸ“š

Welcome to my Research Tools & Methods guide! I created this during my university studies to share what I learned about academic research in a simple and helpful way.

If you're a student starting research or someone who wants to review the basics, this guide is for you. It covers the main ideas, methods, and tools of research in a clear and easy-to-understand way. ðŸŽ¯
